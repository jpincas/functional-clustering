# Stage 3
## Clustering

You can probably guess what’s coming next.  Clustering is the core of the excercise and is the hardest and most time consuming stage.  I was still making changes to my results multiple months after ‘completing’ the exercise and there are still changes I think I will need to make soon.

After the pruning stage, you should still have a large number of little slips laid out in front of you.  Now it’s time to start creating some order out of the chaos.

The objective of this stage is to organise the items into thematic groups, or ‘clusters’.  There is no fixed number of clusters, nor any fixed schema for defining what the clusters should be - that’s why this stage is so mend bending yet so revealing and therapeutic.  It is your job to work out how these little jigsaw pieces fit together - the problem is that you have no picture to guide you!

Start by grouping items that you feel go naturally together.  It will probably be easy at first and there will probably be some really obviously clusters right from the outset.  In my experience these tend to be clusters that relate to work and professional life, excercise and hobbies.

**Don’t try to put a name or definition on the clusters yet.**  Obviously you might have some idea that a particular cluster relates to ‘hobbies’ but don’t label it yet.  It’s important that the clusters are maleable right up until the end of the stage.

You will probably quite easily create 3-4 clusters without much thinking but you’ll probably be left with a little pile of stragglers that you don’t really know what to do with.  Abstract concepts, experiences, personality traits - all those things are hard to ‘cluster’, but it is these items that will unlock the excercise - trust me.

Once you get to this stage, start reevaluating whether the initial ‘obvious’ clusters are too simplistic.  You put ‘walking’ into a cluster with ‘swimming’ and ‘judo’ but do you really walk for excercise? Might it go better with ‘meditation’ or even ‘escapism’?

Let your clusters shift and flow.  Break them down and rebuild them over and over again. The best clustering pattern gradually reveals truths about you and your life - it is these truths we are after.  That’s why fewer clusters are better than more clusters - it gets you closer to the universal traits and characteristics that represent you.  To take this idea to its logical conclusion: imagine if you could reduce everything down to one cluster.  You would have defined yourself with a single concept.  Noone doing this excercise will likely achieve such a precise self-definition, and that’s not our aim, but 5-10 clusters is a superb result, and at least for me, was a transformational level of functional self-definition.

Don’t be afraid to combine clusters in what looks like a tree or hierarchical structure.  You might not be able to represent it very well with simple clusters of slips of paper, but that doesn’t matter.  If you feel that one cluster is really a sub-cluster of another, combine them.

One thing that tends to happen at this stage is that some of the slips you wrote down in stage 1 start to emerge as candidates for the ‘definition’ of a cluster.  Say you wrote down ‘football’, ‘basketball’ and ‘sports’ in stage 1 and have clustered them together.  At this point ’sports’ is pretty meaningless, so there are two things you can do: get rid of it (perfectly valid) or consider that it might be the ‘title’ for the cluster (more useful).  In the latter case, I like to turn that slip vertically and put it next to the developing cluster. It will probably not end up being the final title of the cluster, but it's a good placeholder.

As with the other stages, give this stage ample time to ‘cook’.  Keep coming back to the clusters regularly, making tweaks or even wholesale restructurings.  I recommend you take regular photos so you can go back and look at early ‘drafts’ and so can be confident that if you do make any big changes that you end up wanting to go back on, you can do so.

Once your clusters have remaining unchanged for at least two weeks, you’re probably more or less done.

## Tips

- Tackle the obvious clusters first
- The fewer the clusters the better
- Don’t try to define or label at this stage
- Some slips from stage 1 might be good candidates for cluster ‘title’, rotate them vertical
- Your clusters are highly personal, forget about fixed definitions of ‘areas of life’ you’ve heard before
- Don’t be afraid to reorganise at any point
- Take lots of photos as you go

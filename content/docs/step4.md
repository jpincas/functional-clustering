# Stage 4
## Defining

By now you should be looking at a clear and well organised functional self-definition in the form your ‘clusters’.  Your task now is to find a definition/title/label for each cluster.

The stage is deceptively simple but how you approach it can make or break the utility of the exercise to you.  Definition, in carefully chosen words, injects a level of completeness into the excercise that I think can bring great satisfaction and clarity.  Choose your words carefully - they represent the end to your search for answers to questions like “What do you do?”, “What do you like?”, or maybe even “Who are you?”.

The trick is to be as specific as the cluster allows.  The more general the definition, the less useful.  “Economics” is good, “Socioeconomics” is better “Ethical Socioeconomics” is even better.  Don’t go too narrow though, allow yourself space to breathe and expand.

Think deeply about what each cluster means to you and what makes your approach to it unique.  A good definition will help you in the future in so many ways, it will provide a level of clarity that only comes through carefully chosen words.

This stage can take just as long as the clustering process itself and again, lends itself to constant reflection.  I went back and forth multiple times on the definition of each cluster before finding words and phrases I was truly happy with.

## Tips

- Words are powerful, so choose them carefully
- Be as narrow as possible, without pigeonholing yourself

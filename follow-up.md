# Follow-Up Exercises

I devised a series of follow-up exercises that are designed to lock down the clusters and make them more and more engrained in my psyche.  There are, of course, loads of things you can do, but here are some ideas.

## Write a New Social Bio

You shouldn’t struggle to write a social bio ever again,  just summarise all your clusters.

Define each cluster without words

This one is great fun.  During the excercise we defined each cluster with words, but there are many more ways you can define your clusters.  You could define each cluster with:

- A colour
- An image
- A role-model 
- A song
- A book

## Organise/Prune your digital subscriptions/follows

Use your clusters to organise and prune your digital life.  Get rid of anything that didn’t make the cut in your clusters.  For example, I always felt overwhelmed by the number of Podcast subscriptions I had and the fact that I couldn’t keep up with them occupied a certain amount of mental space.  I decided to pick just a single podcast for each cluster.

## Make Commitments

You may have included certain items in your clusters that haven’t had much love for a while.  Perhaps you kept ‘Running’ but haven’t even been out for a jog for 10 years.  Remember I warned against keeping items ‘just in case’.  Whatever made it into your clusters needs to actioned - it can’t just sit there.  Take some time to reactive any dormant activities or at least make a start in working out how you are going to squeeze them in.

## Have a clean out

How much physical stuff do you have that relates to items in your ‘reject’ pile? Now’s the time for a big clearout.  Have a big sort and enjoy saying goodbye to old items that don’t fit in with your clusters.  Decluttering should be joyful and leave you renewed and refreshed.

## Give Thanks

Go over your reject list and give thanks for the items that didn’t make the Final Cut.  What ‘giving thanks’ exactly means to you I can’t say.  Personally I just reflected on each item and tried to make peace with the rejection process.  Giving something up and can hard, but if we don’t do it, life gets too cluttered to manage.

## Cross-Fertilise

A really interesting excercise is to try to identify connections between your clusters.  It is these connections that make you truly unique.   Start by connected just two clusters and then work your way up.  Can you find a general theme that connects everything (the holy grail of self definition)? 

## Goals

Make one or more goals for each cluster.  Mix short, medium and long term goals.

## Mirror

Excercise extreme caution with this one.  Have somebody else do the excercise as if they were you.

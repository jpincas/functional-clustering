## An exercise in focus and self-definition for multifaceted personalities

I’ve been grappling with being a ‘generalist’ rather than a ‘specialist’ for my whole adult life.  I've always envied people who could clearly define themselves with a single word or phrase like ‘musician’ or ‘programmer’.  Everybody told me that being a generalist made me unique, but I never felt that way.  I always just felt like a jack-of-all-trades, a professional amateur or a serial dabbler.

**In late 2022, I finally solved my problem.**

It didn’t come in the form of acceptance of my generalism, nor was it a decision to pivot to being an outright specialist (At 42, it’s probably too late in life for me to do that, even if I could).  **Instead it came in the form of a simple exercise that gave me clarity, focus and insight into the multiple areas of my life and personality that have always seemed so disparate.**

The exercise is simple and anyone can do it.  If you’re anything like me it will give you a new level of clarity, focus, insight, understanding and motivation.

If you can easily describe yourself with one word and don’t spend too much time thinking about how the various elements of your life and personality fit together, this probably won't help you much.  If, on the other hand, your life seems like a giant puzzle and it keeps you awake at night, I believe this exercise has the potential to be life changing.

If you get something out of it, please share it widely and freely - even better, coach someone through the exercise once you’ve done it yourself!**

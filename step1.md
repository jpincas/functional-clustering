# Step 1
## Taking Inventory

The first thing you will do is take a massive and in-depth inventory of everything, writing each item on one of the slips of paper.  Imagine walking around your house and making a list of everything in it - you will be doing that, but for your life and self.

I should say that you are not making a chronological list of all the things you’ve done, although those things will form an important part of the inventory.  You are trying to capture every element of your past, present and potentially future self and everything else that encompasses.  Here’s a long but still incomplete list of ideas:

- Every hobby you’ve ever had
- Every subject you studied to A-Level and beyond
- Anything you’ve studied or research independently as an adult
- Every sport/physical pursuit you’ve tried at least twice
- All areas of general intellectual curiosity
- Other things you like to do in your free time
- Activities you did often as a kid
- Every job title you’ve ever had
- Professional areas you’d like to get into
- Things on your bucket list
- Important facets of your personality
- Any obvious dreams or goals, whether you’ve started working towards them or not
- Anything you’re vaguely attracted to but don’t know why
- Languages you speak, or have studied (apart from native language)
- Musical instruments you play
- Small things you do to boost wellbeing (taking a walk, meditating etc)
- Anything lurking in the back of your mind that your inner voice tells you you should be doing or be interesting in
- Anything you care deeply about
- Anything you think you should care deeply about
- Groups/clubs you belong to
- Specific groups/circles of friends
- Subscriptions
- Experiences you’ve had
- Important trips you’ve been on
- Your bucket list
- Important people in your life

Above all, don’t filter: just write it down.  Capture everything - this is not the stage to apply any thought or analysis - just take stock.  Be extremely thorough, think back through your past, year by year if necessary.  It’s very important you capture everything, otherwise the rest of the excercise won’t work as well.

This stage could take anything from a few days to a few weeks.  At first the ideas will come thick and fast and you will probably fill 20-30 slips in the first hour.  After that, the stream will gradually slow to a trickle as you get towards full inventory.  Once a few days to a week have passed without you writing anything down, you can be quite confident you’re done.

If you do happen to think of anything else once you’ve advanced from this stage, don’t worry, write it down and add it in.

## Tips

- Write down absolutely everything

## An exercise in focus and self-definition for multifaceted personalities

I’ve been grappling with being a ‘generalist’ rather than a ‘specialist’ for basically my entire adult life.  I envied people who could clearly define themselves with a single word or phrase like ‘musician’ or ‘writer’.  Everybody told me that being a generalist made me unique, but I never felt that way.  I always just felt like a jack-of-all-trades, a professional amateur, an imposter.

**In late 2022, I finally solved my problem.**

It didn’t come in the form of acceptance of my generalism, nor was it a decision to pivot to being an outright specialist (it’s probably too late in life for me to do that, even if I could).  **Instead it came in the form of a simple excersise that gave me clarity, focus and insight into the multiple areas of my life and personality that have always seemed so disparate.**

This is not a commercial product or service.  It's a simple website where I’ve written out how to do the excercise because I think it could be valuable to many people.  If you get something out of it, please share it widely and freely - even better, coach someone through the excercise once you’ve done it yourself!

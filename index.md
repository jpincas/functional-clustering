## An exercise in focus and self-definition for multifaceted personalities

I’ve been grappling with being a ‘generalist’ rather than a ‘specialist’ for basically my entire adult life.  I envied people who could clearly define themselves with a single word or phrase like ‘musician’ or ‘writer’.  Everybody told me that being a generalist made me unique, but I never felt that way.  I always just felt like a jack-of-all-trades, a professional amateur, an imposter.

**In late 2022, I finally solved my problem.**

It didn’t come in the form of acceptance of my generalism, nor was it a decision to pivot to being an outright specialist (it’s probably too late in life for me to do that, even if I could).  **Instead it came in the form of a simple excersise that gave me clarity, focus and insight into the multiple areas of my life and personality that have always seemed so disparate.**

>> The excercise is simple and anyone can do it.  If you’re anything like me it will give you a new level of clarity, focus, insight, understanding and motivation.

If you can easily describe yourself with one word and don’t spend too much time thinking about what your life means, where it’s going, how it all fits together etc., this probably isn’t for you.  If like me, however, your life seems like a giant puzzle and it keeps you awake at night, I truly believe the excercise has the potential to be life changing.

**This is not a commercial product or service.  It's a simple website where I’ve written out how to do the excercise because I think it could be valuable to many people.  If you get something out of it, please share it widely and freely - even better, coach someone through the excercise once you’ve done it yourself!**

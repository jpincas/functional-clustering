# Stage 2
## Pruning

This is where the fun really starts and the self-reflection begins.  If this stage isn’t somewhat emotionally taxing, you’re either not doing it right or possibly never really needed to do the excercise in the first place.

Your job in this stage is to ‘reject’ a large number of those little slips of paper.

What does ‘reject’ mean? It means you are ready to say goodbye to that ‘thing’, whatever it is.  If you’re the type that has trouble getting rid of an old t-shirt or a ceramic doll that’s been in a box for 20 years, you’re going to struggle with this, but it's the most crucial part of the excercise.

You should ‘say goodbye’ to the things that you are ready to accept no longer, and at least in the short-to-medium-term, will no longer, form part of your life.  These could be hobbies, interests, people, television shows, habits - anything goes.  The purpose is to create space. This doesn't mean that you will never do that thing again, it just means you won't expend any excess energy on thinking about it, worrying about it and/or fretting about the fact that you are not doing it.

You should undertake this process from a place of love and self-kindness.  If you’ve ever seen how Mari Kondo teaches her clients how to declutter their homes, you’ll understand the process.  Think about each slip of paper - what do you feel when you read that word? Does it spark joy and excitement? Or does it trigger feelings of dread or guilt? If you feel a sense of release and relief when 'rejecting' an item, that's a sure sign it's been taking up mental space and causing unnecessary anxiety.

Be realistic and be ruthless.  You probably don’t have time to do all the things you think you should be doing and this process is supposed to help you focus on what matters.  So say goodbye to as much as you realistically can.  Of course, there’s nothing to stop you going back on your decision in the future, but don’t use that possibility as an excuse to be indecisive: **anything that stays represents a commitment to devote time and energy and anything that goes is, at least for the foreseeable future, not a part of your life.**

>> Let me just repeat that last bit.  Don’t keep anything ‘just in case’.  If it stays, you will need to make a commitment to it, however small.

Here’s a pro tip.  Whilst you’re going through stage 2, I recommend maintaining 2 ‘rejected’ piles: a firm reject pile and a ‘not sure’ pile.  You’ll need to eventually clear the ‘not sure’ pile but it’s a very useful half-way step which means you don’t have to make a firm decision in the moment.  If you're undecided about an item, just put it in the ‘not sure’ pile and carry on.

This stage really benefits from the passing of time and I recommend spending 50% more time pruning than you did taking inventory.  Let your ‘not sure’ pile build up, then sleep on it (multiple times).  Ponder the decisions you’re making as you drive to work or cook dinner.  Come back to the excercise daily and see how the current spread of items looks and feels to you.

If a week or more has gone by without you making any changes to your ‘rejected’ pile, you can probably move on.  Don’t discard your rejected items - leave them neatly laid out in columns next to the other slips because you might still go back and make fine adjustments while completing the remaining stages.

## Tips

- Don’t keep items ‘just in case’
- Be realistic
- Use a temporary ‘not sure’ pile, but eliminate it before the end of this stage
- Prune as much as possible
- Pay close attention to the feelings produced when ‘rejecting’ an item. Relief is a good sign you're making the right choice.
- Rejection doesn't necessarily mean you will never do that thing again

# Finishing the the Exercise

Congratulations - you’re done!  

I recommend sticking down your little strips of paper in their clusters on the big sheet of card and writing your chosen definitions in bold marker pen above each cluster.  I also recommend sticking down all the ‘rejected’ slips too (I made two continuous columns on the right of the card).

The actually process of working through the exercise will hopefully have brought you great clarity and focus through many hours of self reflection.  The result should be used as a blueprint and guide to keep you on course.  I often come back to my clusters when feeling unfocussed, mentally foggy or out of balance.  My clusters are my guide when I’m being pulled in many directions, when my inner voice is barking orders or I’m tempted to go down rabbit holes that I really shouldn’t.  

I’ll never be a specialist, but I now no longer feel like a lost jack-of-all-trades.  I know what I’m interested in and what I’m good at and have realised it’s not *that* many things.  

It’s manageable.  

I’ve put words on those things.  

I can define them and think and talk about them in a more structured way.  

**In some ways I feel like 7 specialists all in one.**
